# Databases_Flight_Tracker
For this project, I created a database using SQL to store information about flights (ie. their departure/arrival time and date, the company operating them, etc.). I then created a website using HTML and Bootstrap to allow users to search for all sorts of information about the flight. In the back-end, I performed queries on the database to get the results and then displayed them on the website for the user to see. I utilized Python Flask to structure the backend of this website.

1. Start mysql database server (I used MAMP)- click on phpmyadmin.
2. Execute "create.sql" and "insert.sql" to create database titled "Airline_Reservation".
4. Run "init.py" to start up website. 
5. Type 127.0.0.1:4000 in address bar to view website.
